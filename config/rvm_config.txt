Ok, for anyone who tried to install RVM using sudo and is now pulling
their hair out trying to get it to install in $HOME/.rvm, here's what
did it for me:

When you installed RVM using sudo, it created a file /etc/rvmrc, which contains the following:
    umask g+w
    export rvm_path="/usr/local/rvm"

This makes all future attempts at installation (even when not run as sudo)
install into /usr/local/rvm, which is NOT what you want for a single
user installation. So remove /etc/rvmrc and then you can run

    bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)

and it will install properly into $HOME/.rvm
