# These are the commands I ran to put new field into the database:

# Add start_date and end_date
ALTER TABLE `events` ADD `start_date` DATE NOT NULL AFTER `question2` ,
ADD `end_date` DATE NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER `start_date`

# Do this every time the webpage runs
    //$query = "set sql_mode = 'traditional,no_zero_date';";
    $query = "set sql_mode = '';";
    $result = mysql_query($query);
    if (mysql_error($dbconn))
        UTILdberror($query);


# Make sure the log file (./log/errorlog.log) is writable by ANYONE, or else php can't write it

# Note that if you change to 'traditional,no_zero_date' in the mysql console,
# it's changing that for EVERYBODY!!
# On the contrary, setting it from php doesn't do anything yet.

mysql_error() is a FUNCTION
