# Enabled the rewrite module with the following command:
    sudo a2enmod rewrite

# Put the following near the top of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:
# Note that DocumentRoot has been changed, as the rewrite rules are all
# appended to DocumentRoot. (There is also a RewriteBase, but I'm not sure
# how to use it.

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteOptions Inherit
        RewriteRule /s /support.php
        DocumentRoot /home/jd/php/regi
        ...


# Or you can do it like this in .htaccess:
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^z$ support.php?_REQUEST=$1 [L]
# But note that you must have DocumentRoot set to /home/jd/php/regi for this to work
# Don't know how to get it to work in specific cases only

# NOTE THAT YOU MUST NOT HAVE A SLASH BEFORE THE JUNK

Question: Why is REGI coming up at http://localhost as well as http://localhost/regi?
Answer: Oh, it's because DocumentRoot is set there.
