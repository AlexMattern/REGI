This is what I did:

[hbboston@srv02 ~]$ pear config-create /home/hbboston/pear .pearrc

and it said:

Successfully created default configuration file "/home/hbboston/.pearrc"


Then I added the following to .bashrc:
PATH=$PATH:~/pear/bin
export PATH

reopened bash and ran:

pear install -o PEAR

which ran mostly successfully

Then the instructions at
    http://beni.hallinger.org/peardoc/en/html/installation.shared.html
say to

<?php
ini_set('include_path', '~/pear/lib' . PATH_SEPARATOR
        . ini_get('include_path'));

// From PHP 4.3.0 onward, you can use the following,
// which especially useful on shared hosts:
set_include_path('/home/hbboston/pear/pear/php' . PATH_SEPARATOR
                 . get_include_path());

//Note that the absolute path is required. I tested with relative, and it didn't work.
?>


still couldn't install. says needs pear/ole
trying this:

pear config-set preferred_state beta
pear install OLE-1.0.0RC1
pear install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer
pear config-set preferred_state stable
