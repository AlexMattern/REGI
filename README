REGI

Here's what you need to know to host regi:

HOSTING REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------
php
mysql
sendgrid
pear packages: Swift and Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer

EMAIL
----------------------------------
Email is being sent through Sendgrid
You can log in at sendgrid.com to see how many emails have been sent out
When you install for your particular chapter, you will need your own sendgrid account

PEAR PACKAGES
---------------------------------
Two pear packages are required. 
- Swift
- Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer

Once installed, make sure you update the lines that look like:
set_include_path('/home/hbboston/pear/pear/php' . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
so that they use your include path (where your pear packages are installed)
I suggest you test the email and the spreadsheet export before you launch :)

eLyXer (Support Pages)
---------------------------------

The support documents are composed in a kick-ass editor named LyX. Google it. 
eLyXer is installed as part of this git repository. Just update the .lyx documents, and eLyXer 
will output the corresponding html

UNIT TESTS
-------------------------------
There are unit tests in php/test/unit_tests that you should invoke using
  'phpunit test_name.php'
I suggest running these before each deploy. In particular, they check 
the password hashing routine.

SECURITY
-------------------------------
There is a document outlining the security used in REGI. It is located at
php/docs/regi_security.lyx
It is likely not a complete document, but it will give you a good idea of the 
password hashing routine that is used

SETTINGS
--------------------------------
To customize REGI for your particular instance,
